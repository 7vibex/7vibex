**`Digital Craftsman (Developer/Filmmaker/Creator)`**

I'm an indie full-stack developer and content creator building my version of the digital world one step at a time. All coding projects are built from the ground up, from planning and designing all the way to solving real-life problems with code. All video content is built the same way, from ideation and planning, all the way to finalizing the content with artistic touches. I publish that content on my YouTube channel "[ForrestKnight][youtube]" to more than 600k subscribers.

 <summary><h3>7vibex Journey</h3></summary>
 I started my coding journey back in middle school as a student with a passion for games and a curiosity about how PCs work. At first, I got into Linux because I was fascinated by the idea of becoming a so-called "hacker." But eventually, I realized it was a bit too much for me at the time, so I switched back to Windows.

That's when I started learning my first programming language: C++. I chose it because I had heard it was used to make games. After learning the basics, I thought that was it â€” that knowing the language was enough. But I quickly discovered there's a lot more to programming than just the language itselfâ€¦ and that became my nightmare (still is, to be honest :) ).

Later, I moved on to web development and started learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I practiced by creating cute little projects for my ex (you can see some of them on my profile). But eventually, she broke up with me  and here I am, still coding, still learning, and diving deeper into new languages. -->
